Ai is the new electricity. There is no doubt about it. There is no single industry that would remain untouched from AI. Andrew Ng has famously said,"I can't think of a single industry where AI won't affect the work culture." AI is gonna dwarf all the technological progress that we have seen in the past 30 years.It is really a very exciting time to be alive in my opinion. While I am trying to learn AI and deep learning, I am facing this issue and difficulty of bridging the gap between academia and industry. For example, how to run your AI model on a website. So to resolve these issues, I have decided to share this journey from a academician to a software developer in industry. I hope it would be an exciting one and I and you would learn a lot from it.
